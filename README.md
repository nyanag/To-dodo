# To-dodo
Todo list projects are sooo versatile and are usually the beginning step towards learning a new project. They are simple yet cover
the basics of the language you are learning.

# Resources
The project was bootstrap with CRA (Create React App)

I've learned React mainly from youtube, here is the links for some crash courses :

Besides youtube, there is the official [documentation](https://reactjs.org/) which is a great resources for beginners.
